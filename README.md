# Open Badge Infrastructure
## What?
Brief: Push badges to a hub for your users and let them share badges everywhere (and drive traffic back to your site).
Long: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Badges

## Pushing a badge to the hub
A badge assertion is sent to the hub by making a POST request with the path to the badge assertion. For example:

    $ curl -X POST -d "assertion=https://example.org/bimmys-html5-badge.json" http://hub.example.org/badges

This tells the badge hub to do a GET request to "https://example.org/bimmys-html5-badge.json" and store the badge described by the manifest there.

## Example assertion (with optional fields)
```javascript
{
  "recipient": "bimmy@example.com",
  "evidence": "/badges/html5-basic/bimmy",
  "expires": "2013-06-01",
  "issued_at": "2011-06-01"
  "badge": {
    "version": "0.5.0",
    "name": "HTML5 Fundamental",
    "image": "/img/html5-basic.png",
    "description": "Knows the difference between a <section> and an <article>",
    "criteria": "/badges/html5-basic",
    "issuer": {
      "name": "P2PU",
      "org": "School of Webcraft",
      "contact": "admin@p2pu.org",
      "url": "http://p2pu.org/schools/school-of-webcraft"
    }
  }
}
```
NOTE: If a URL is not fully-qualified it is assumed to be relative to the issuing domain.

## Field Descriptions

### Required
* **recipient**: E-mail address for the user recieving the badge.
* **badge**: The structure for the type of badge being recieved
  * **version**: The version of the spec/hub this manifest is compatible with. *Use "0.5.0" for the beta.*
  * **name**: Human-readable name of the badge being issued. *Maximum of 128 characters.*
  * **image**: URL for image representing the badge. *Should be a square and one of the following formats: PNG, JPG or GIF. Will be cached at the backpack. Maximum size of 512kb.*
  * **description**: Description of the badge being issued. *Maximum of 128 characters.*
  * **criteria**: URL describing the badge and criteria for earning the badge (Not the specific instance of the badge).
  * **issuer**: Information about the issuer:
    * **name** : Human-readable name of the issuing agent.
    * **org**: (OPTIONAL) Organization for which the badge is being issued. Another example is if a scout badge is being issued, the "name" could be "Boy Scouts" and the "org" could be "Troop #218"
    * **contact**: (OPTIONAL) A human-monitored email address associated with the issuer.
    * **url**: (OPTIONAL) Location for the issuer. Defaults to the root issuing domain if not provided.

### Optional
* **evidence**: User-specific URL with information about this specific badge instance. Should contain information about how the specific user earned the badge.
* **expires**: Date when the badge expires. If omitted, the badge never expires. The badge is not removed from the user's backpack after the expires date â€“ there will be some visual/technical indicator that the badge is expired and needs to be re-upped. *Must be formatted "YYYY-MM-DD"*
* **issued_at**: Date when badge was issued. If omitted, the issue date will be set to whenever the hub recieved the badge.  *Must be formatted "YYYY-MM-DD"*

NOTE: We've discussed having an additional field that is customizable by the user - so that the user could add a personal evidence URL, or could add additional information or context to the badge. This would NOT be something that they issuer would include in the badge manifest (so it is not listed above) and would most likely be managed by the user through the Backpack.


## Rationale
It makes sense to separate the "badge" data -- the type & details of the award/achievement being asserted on the user's behalf -- from the "instance" data -- all of the information related to asserting that a specific user should be awarded a badge.

Separating the badge into its own structure will also help moving forward. Discoverability without leaking PII becomes easier, as well as third-party endorsing of badge "classes", rather than having to deal with endorsing either badge instances or issuers, one of which is too specific and the other too broad.
