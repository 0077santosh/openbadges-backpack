# Mozilla Open Badges
## Overview
We intend to provide an open set of specifications, tools and services for
generating verifiable badges that users can take with them wherever they go
and use however they like.

For (a lot) more information, check out http://openbadges.org

## I'm an Issuer, how do I use this?
*Note: we're in rapid development mode now, but we're aiming for a usable beta on Sept 12th.*

Requirements:
* Webserver capable of serving requests to the general internet.
* Ability to make a POST request from your server backend and read a JSON response.
* Email addresses of the users you wish to issue badges.
* Badge image must be in PNG format.

1. Generate an assertion (see below) for the user recieving the badge.
2. Store that assertion at a public-but-secret URL.
  * The assertion contains private information about a user, so you want a
    non-predictable URL scheme to prevent automated scraping.
  
  * This URL should be stable - any badge issued from it relies on its
    existence for verification.
  
  * Both of these problems will be solved in the near-term future by
    supporting signed assertions, so you'll only need to expose a URL
    containing your public key.

3. Make a POST request to the open badge creator with the assertion URL. If
validation passes, you will receive an HTTP 200 with `content-type: image/png`,
the body being a your `badge.image` with the assertion URL baked into it.
4. Send/give the image to the user (for example, email it).

## Example assertion (with optional fields)
```javascript
{
  "recipient": "bimmy@example.com",
  "evidence": "/badges/html5-basic/bimmy",
  "expires": "2013-06-01",
  "issued_on": "2011-06-01",
  "badge": {
    "version": "0.5.0",
    "name": "HTML5 Fundamental",
    "image": "/img/html5-basic.png",
    "description": "Knows the difference between a <section> and an <article>",
    "criteria": "/badges/html5-basic",
    "issuer": {
      "name": "P2PU",
      "org": "School of Webcraft",
      "contact": "admin@p2pu.org",
      "origin": "http://p2pu.org/"
    }
  }
}
```
NOTE: If a URL is not fully-qualified it is assumed to be relative to the issuing domain.

## Field Descriptions

### Required
* **recipient**: E-mail address for the user recieving the badge.
* **badge**: The structure describing the badge.
  * **version**: The version of the spec/hub this manifest is compatible with. *Use "0.5.0" for the beta.*
  * **name**: Human-readable name of the badge being issued. *Maximum of 128 characters.*
  * **image**: URL for image representing the badge. *Should be a square and one of the following formats: PNG, JPG or GIF. Will be cached at the backpack. Maximum size of 512kb.*
  * **description**: Description of the badge being issued. *Maximum of 128 characters.*
  * **criteria**: URL describing the badge and criteria for earning the badge (Not the specific instance of the badge).
  * **issuer**: Information about the issuer:
    * **name** : Human-readable name of the issuing agent.
    * **org**: (OPTIONAL) Organization for which the badge is being issued. Another example is if a scout badge is being issued, the "name" could be "Boy Scouts" and the "org" could be "Troop #218"
    * **contact**: (OPTIONAL) A human-monitored email address associated with the issuer.
    * **url**: (OPTIONAL) Location for the issuer. Defaults to the root issuing domain if not provided.

### Optional
* **evidence**: User-specific URL with information about this specific badge instance. Should contain information about how the specific user earned the badge.
* **expires**: Date when the badge expires. If omitted, the badge never expires. The badge is not removed from the user's backpack after the expires date â€“ there will be some visual/technical indicator that the badge is expired and needs to be re-upped. *Must be formatted "YYYY-MM-DD"*
* **issued_on**: Date when badge was issued. If omitted, the issue date will be set to whenever the hub recieved the badge.  *Must be formatted "YYYY-MM-DD"*

NOTE: We've discussed having an additional field that is customizable by the
user - so that the user could add a personal evidence URL, or could add
additional information or context to the badge. This would NOT be something
that they issuer would include in the badge manifest (so it is not listed
above) and would most likely be managed by the user through the Backpack.
